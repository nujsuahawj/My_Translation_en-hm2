Style Guideline from client:
1.	All UC campus names are treated like brand names and will be left in English 
a.	We will put the translation of hospital units and clinics in parentheses after the English: UCSF Kidney Transplant (Trasplante Renal de UCSF).
2.	We will not translate street and city names if they are part of the address. If the city is mentioned in a sentence, then please translate. Example: UCLA provides services in Los Angeles.  
3.	We will not translate proper nouns – names of people are OK to leave in English.  Names of cities, geographical features, etc.  – see #2 above.
a.	Do not translate the health care providers titles. Leave titles as is. For example: Brent Michael Lem, MD or Kayley Lai, RN 
4.	Please always spell out the dates
a.	For example in Spanish: for 05/17/22 change to "17 de mayo de 2022" 
5.	The url (if any) would remain the same – untranslated. The text would be translated unless it fits into one of the categories above. For example; “you can find the numbers for the UCSF Cancer Center on our web page”: UCSF Cancer Center (translation in parentheses). “Go to John Smith MD personal page”: John Smith MD would not be translated. “You can find information about diabetes management on our website”: Diabetes management would be translated.
